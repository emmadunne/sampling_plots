In the Moenave type section, near Tuba City, Arizona, all of the Moenave section is Dinosaur Canyon Member, as it is throughout the Moenave outcrop belt along the Echo Cliffs and Ward's Terrace of northern Arizona.

(2011: Palaeo3 302: 194-205) proposed, on the basis of multiple lines of biostratigraphic evidence, that the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is placed within the middle part of the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation where this member is present, and high in the Dinosaur Canyon Member elsewhere.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

The high density of channel deposits incised into overbank sediments in the Petrified Forest Member indicate that avulsions were common on the Late Triassic landscape of the Chama Basin, and therefore that the Petrified Forest Member fluvial systems were unstable in this area.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones.

The bonebed is most likely older than Jurassic, however, because it is located considerably below Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) basalts in local section. The Portuguese CAMP basalts have been radioisotopically dated at 198.1 Ma, which would place the basalts in the earliest Jurassic (Sinemurian). However, these dates need to be corrected for decay constant bias and are likely to be a few million years older. In any event, the Portuguese basalts are likely somewhat younger than many other radioisotopically dated CAMP sections in North America and North Africa. A more precise Triassic age determination of the bonebed is not currently possible, because the stratigraphy and geochronology of the Gres de Silves Formation have only been studied in cursory detail. Our research group is currently revising the geology of the formation, and we recently tentatively proposed, based on vertebrate biostratigraphy, that at least part of the ‘AB2’ unit (i.e., that containing the Penina Bonebed) is likely to be late Carnian–Norian in age"" (Brusatte et al. 2014)","""The fossil-bearing bed is a 40 cm thick layer of fine sandstone with a high clay content, that crops out over a length of just 10 m...The layer contains several large bone fragments whose white-bluish colour is conspicuous in the light-red sandstone matrix...The fossiliferous layers at both localities consist of lenses of sandstone within an approximately 200 m thick sequence of red mudstones, the thickest member of the Grès de Silves Formation.""

The palaeoenvironment can be reconstructed as a broad coastal plain with several streams flowing into the sea, and sediment from the nearby, raised hinterland accumulated in fans on the shore (Palain 1976). Schröter (1981) interpreted the mudstones as deltaic sediments with the lenses of sandstone being fluviatile deposits, e.g., from anastomosing deltaic streams. Alternatively, he pointed out that the mudstones might represent tidal sediments, and the lenses of sandstones could be the fillings of estuarine channels.

The base of this sequence cuts about 1 m down into underlying red mudstone and sandstone. The sandstone layer containing the fossil shows no obvious bedding and is poorly sorted, perhaps due to bioturbation.""",sandstone,,,conglomeratic,,,,,,,terrestrial indet.,rift,,macrofossils,,,,,,NA,,,good,,,,,,,,,,,"""The skull of NSM 998GF45.1 was preserved with its dorsal side facing up. The mandible is preserved in tight occlusion, and it was not possible to separate the upper and lower teeth without incurring damage to the fossil. The rostral tip of the snout was accidentally destroyed at the time of discovery, and the apices of the spine-like bony processes on the quadratojugal were slightly rubbed during subsequent handling. The right paroccipital process and part of the posterior portion of the right mandibular ramus were apparently lost prior to burial. Most of the cranial sutures are clearly visible. The skull was associated with an incomplete interclavicle and small fragments of vertebrae and limb-bones. In places, small pebbles were pressed into the underlying bone, resulting in a distinctly 'pock-marked' appearance of the external surfaces of the cranial bones.""",taxonomic,"surface (in situ),survey of museum collection",,,,,Anson Brown,1983,NSM: Nova Scotia Museum,,terrestrial,NA,actively mobile,,NA,,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,NA,Hypsognathus,,,NA,fenneri,,"H.-D.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

Based on the mapped offset of the position of the Lockatong Formation pinch-out on the east and the boundary between the Stockton and Hammer Creek formations on the west side of the dike, the stratigraphic position of Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus should be between the upper Lockatong Formation and the Graters Member of the Passaic Formation, most likely somewhere close to member D or E-F (Fig. 1).

In 2002, we acquired samples of a tuffaceous sandstone at the base of the Blue Mesa Member locally and had the detrital zircons analysed by U-Pb geochronology, but were unable to report results until Heckert et al. (2009). Other workers have also obtained age estimates for this horizon, including Irmis and Mundil (2008) and Irmis et al. (2011) Despite using three different techniques, each at different laboratories, all have estimated an age of approximately 220 Ma (Table 1). As a detrital zircon estimate, this is by definition a maximum age, and the dated horizon is approximately 43 m above the Doswellia occurrence, so it is possible that the site is as much as several million years older than 220 Ma. However, given the rarity of Late Triassic age constraints associated with biostratigraphically useful tetrapods, c. 220 Ma is a reasonable approximation for the numerical age of the D. sixmilensis type locality, although it is several million years younger than the age estimates of homotaxial strata recently published by Ramezani et al. (2011)."" \r\n\r\nAlthough Heckert et al (2012) argue that an age of 220 Ma places this locality in the Carnian, most recent work and recent geological timescales use an age of approximately 228 Ma for the Carnian/Norian boundary (e.g. International Committee on Stratigraphy, 2012) and so the locality is entered here as Norian.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common. The conglomerates alternate with finer layers of green to pale grey mudstone and siltstone that often include root traces and other organics, but do not show any large-scale evidence of oxidation.""",conglomerate,"gypsiferous,intraclastic,brown,yellow",,sandy,Y,siltstone,"gray,green",,,,coarse channel fill,,"""repeated transient flooding events concentrated vertebrate (bones, carcasses, live animals) and plant material from the landscape surface, possibly in hyperconcentrated flows. These events were separated by periods of standing water and weakly-developed, poorly-drained (hydromorphic) soil formation. The hydromorphic nature of the paleosols is evidenced by the drab matrix colorations, abundance of yellow-brown (goethite) mottles, preservation of organic matter, including local leaf litter, predominance of goethite rhizocretions, and general dearth of other redoximorphic features. The high density of channel deposits incised into overbank sediments in the Petrified Forest Member indicate that avulsions were common on the Late Triassic landscape of the Chama Basin, and therefore that the Petrified Forest Member fluvial systems were unstable in this area. This large-scale instability in the local base level and resulting incision has also been reported for the Petrified Forest Member in northern Arizona""",macrofossils,,,,,,NA,,body,good,,,concentrate,concentrated,,,,occasional,,,,taxonomic,"selective quarrying,mechanical,field collection",,,,,"Irmis, Nesbitt, Turner, et. al.",2006-,,,terrestrial,NA,actively mobile,,NA,,,,,hydroxyapatite,,,NA,Drepanosaurus,,,NA,unguicaudatus,,"A.
